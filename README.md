# Student-Engagement-Problem
Multiclass Regression problem on the DAISEE dataset.
The model uses InceptionNet trained on Vggface2 for feature extraction and tcn for sequential modeling. 
Objective is Predicting the Student Engagement Intensity using Temporal Convolutional Attention-based Networks. We will also modify the MSE loss to concordance correlation coefficient loss.
